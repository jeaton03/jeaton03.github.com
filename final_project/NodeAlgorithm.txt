1.)	If there are no nodes, the member gets his/her
	  own node.
2.)	Else, find the closest node and distance to that
	  node.
3.)	If potential new member is within the radius of
	  the node (+0.25 mi) then add them to that node
4.) Check if the node needs to be broken up

1.)	Check each node
2.)	Find all cars outside the radius (+0.10 mi) and
	  see if they can be grouped with another node or
	  if they can be grouped together.
3.) If they are grouped with eachother, keep conversation
4.) If they are grouped with another node, prompt the user
	  to either switch or stay in the same group.
5.)	If they stay in the same node, mark them as a distant
	  member.
6.) Readjust center and radius of node.

1.)	Check if radius is more than 1.25 mi
2.)	Make a list of all members outside of the 1.25 mi radius
3.)	See if they can be grouped in another node
4.) See if they can be grouped with other exciled members
5.)	Readjust center and radius of node.
