SERVER INTERACTION NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------

When a user allows our site to aquire his location, a POST AJAX
request is sent to /new_user/ with the field latlng.

The server will respond back with an id for that user. The id will
not be sent back as a JSON object, but rather plaintext.

--------------------------------------------------------------

If you send a GET ajax request to /messages/

IMPORTANT: If you query /messages/, you must include the field
 userid and you also may include
a last_id field which represents the most recent message id
that has been received. If no last_id field is provided in
the request, the server will assume that you want ALL the
messages since you submitted the user's name.

You should expect back an ARRAY of JSON objects with the following fields:

Field Name | Representation
---------------------------
sender ... | The name of the sender as determined by the user
message .. | The content of the actual message that was sent
when ..... | The timestamp of the message when it was RECEIVED by the server

Do NOT parse the string received back from this query. It is an ARRAY of JSON objects, not a single object.

--------------------------------------------------------------

If you are SENDING a message to the server, send a POST ajax request to /send_message/

The format of the JSON object must have the following fields:

Field Name | Representation
---------------------------
sender_id. | The ID of the sender as determined by the server
message .. | The content of the actual message that was sent
location . | The LatLng of the sender at the time of the message being sent (or the
.............. last known location of the sender.

The server will respond back with a JSON object with three fields:

Field Name .. | Representation
-------------------------------
group_id .... | The id number of the group
center_latlng | Center of the circle of the users current group
radius ...... | Radius of said circle

--------------------------------------------------------------

This should be sufficient to allow you guys to create the front-end portion of this site.
